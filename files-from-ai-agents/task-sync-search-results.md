# Task Sync and External Source Search Results

## Search Objective
Find code related to:
1. Reading tasks from dvo88.com or MyProjects
2. Task export/sync functionality
3. Task delegation mechanisms
4. API endpoints for task retrieval
5. Any code that fetches or monitors external task sources

## Key Findings

### 1. **No Direct Integration with dvo88.com or MyProjects**
- No files found containing references to "dvo88", "myprojects", or "MyProjects" in the API/sync context
- The `extract_projects.py` file reads from a local HTML file (`/dvo88-landing/index.html`) but doesn't fetch from the web

### 2. **Task Distribution System Found**

#### **Maestro Task Sender** (`/maestro_task_sender.py`)
- Sends tasks to Claude instances (UC, DC, AC)
- Creates JSON files in `maestro_tasks/` directory
- Supports different task types: architecture, bash commands, general tasks
- Can distribute tasks across multiple instances

#### **Captain Task Processor** (`/maestro_tasks/captain_task_processor.py`)
- Processes tasks from Alpine Maestro
- Delegates to team members (Codex for architecture, Jules for implementation)
- Analyzes tasks based on keywords to determine delegation
- Sends tasks via HTTP POST to local API endpoints

### 3. **A2A (Agent-to-Agent) System**

#### **Task Monitoring** (`/a2a-system/monitor_tasks.py`)
- Monitors tasks via HTTP GET from `http://127.0.0.1:5003/tasks`
- Real-time display of task assignments
- Shows tasks assigned to codex, jules, or all agents

#### **Task Submission** (`/a2a-system/shared/submit_dashboard_tasks.py`)
- Submits tasks via HTTP POST to `http://127.0.0.1:5000/add_task`
- Assigns tasks to specific agents (codex or jules)

### 4. **Local Task Storage**
- Tasks are stored in JSON files:
  - `maestro_tasks/uc_tasks.json`
  - `maestro_tasks/dc_tasks.json`
  - `maestro_tasks/ac_tasks.json`
  - `shared/tasks.json` (currently empty)

### 5. **API Endpoints Found**

#### **Maestro API Server** (`/maestro_tasks/maestro_api_server.py`)
- `/maestro/process` - Processes user requests
- Saves requests to `user_requests.json`
- Integrates with Alpine Maestro Controller

#### **Calendar Backend** (`/calendar-backend/task-api.js`)
- RESTful API for task management
- `/api/tasks` - Get all tasks
- `/api/tasks/:type` - Get tasks by type (work/personal)
- POST endpoints for adding tasks
- No external source integration

### 6. **Project Delegation Document**
- `dvo88_projects_delegation.md` contains manual task assignments
- Lists projects from dvo88.com but doesn't fetch them programmatically
- Static delegation plan, not automated

## Conclusion

**No automated task syncing from external sources (dvo88.com or MyProjects) was found.**

The system currently:
1. Uses manual task creation through the Maestro system
2. Stores tasks locally in JSON files
3. Distributes tasks via local API calls
4. Has no web scraping or external API integration for task fetching

To read tasks from dvo88.com or MyProjects, you would need to:
1. Create a web scraper or API client
2. Add authentication if required
3. Parse the task data
4. Integrate with the existing Maestro task distribution system
5. Schedule regular sync operations
