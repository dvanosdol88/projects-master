# Recommendations for Your "JACK" Project

Based on the files you've provided, here are some recommendations for organization, staying up-to-date, automation, and tool communication.

## 1. Organizing and Streamlining Your Project

Your project already has a good foundation for organization. Here's how you can build on it:

* **Finalize and Follow Your Folder Structure:** You've started a good folder structure. Continue to use it consistently. The `AGENTS.md` file outlines this structure, which is a great reference for all collaborators.
    * `docs/`: For all documentation, including session notes and usage guides.
    * `assets/`: For images, screenshots, and other non-code assets.
    * `cheatsheets/`: For quick reference guides and conventions.
    * `dashboards/`: For files related to your dashboard project.
* **Maintain the `todo.md` file:** This file is your central hub for project tasks and priorities. Regularly review and update it to keep everyone aligned. The file clearly lays out prioritized tasks, from getting the file structure in place to future goals like "Project AIRIA".
* **Use `AGENTS.md` as Your Rulebook:** This file is crucial for defining how your AI agents, "Jules" and "Claude Code," should interact with the project. It sets expectations for file organization, Git guidelines, and agent-specific instructions.
* **Leverage the `JACK_Project_Summary.md`:** This document provides a high-level overview of your project's goals, what has been accomplished, the roles of each component, and the immediate next steps. Keep this updated as the project evolves to quickly onboard new collaborators or to refresh your own memory.

## 2. Keeping Things Up-to-Date for All Parties

Effective communication and clear documentation are key to keeping everyone in the loop.

* **Regularly Create Session Notes:** Your `docs/session-notes-2025-06-28.md` is a great example of how to document progress. Continue to create these after each work session. You can even use the prompt templates in `# JACK - Prompt Templates.md` to standardize the creation of these notes.
* **Use the `check_jack_commits.sh` Script:** This script is a great way to quickly see the recent work done by "Jules" and "Claude Code". Run it regularly to monitor their activity.
* **Clear Commit Messages:** Your `AGENTS.md` file already mentions the importance of clear commit messages. Enforce this rule to make it easy to understand the history of the project just by looking at the Git log.

## 3. Automating Your Processes

You've already started with automation, which is great. Here's how you can take it further:

* **Expand Your CI/CD Pipeline:** You have a basic CI pipeline in `.github/workflows/ci.yml` that runs tests. You can expand this to:
    * **Automated Linting and Formatting:** Add steps to your workflow to automatically check for code style issues and format the code. This will ensure consistency.
    * **Automated Deployment:** If "Jules" is a web service, you can automate its deployment to a staging or production environment after all tests pass.
* **Automate Session Note Creation:** In your `# JACK - Prompt Templates.md`, you have a template for creating session notes. You could write a script that uses this template to automatically generate a new session note file with the current date, which can then be filled in.
* **Automate Task Updates:** Explore ways to have your `todo.md` file automatically updated when tasks are added or completed via the `jack_cli.py` tool.

## 4. Improving Tool Communication and Summarization

This is the core of your "JACK" project. Here are some ways to enhance communication and summarization:

* **Use the `jack_cli.py` for Tasking:** Your `jack_cli.py` is the primary way to send tasks to "Jules". Make sure all team members are familiar with its usage, as documented in `docs/jack_usage.md`.
* **Standardize Agent Communication:** Your `# JACK - Prompt Templates.md` is a good start. Continue to develop and refine these templates for common tasks. This will make the communication between your agents more reliable and predictable.
* **Daily Summaries:** You can create a process to generate a daily summary of work. This could be a new script that:
