# JCC Project Summary and Framework

**Date:** 2025-06-27

## Project Goals

- Establish robust AI-to-AI communication framework between two agents: CC and Jules (now collectively referred to as **JCC**).
- Enable task handoffs, shared context, and status reporting between JCC agents via HTTP APIs.
- Build scalable foundation for orchestration, monitoring, and mission control.

## What We Have Done So Far

1Ô∏è‚É£ **Flask API Built (Jules)**  
- Task endpoints:
  - `POST /add_task`
  - `GET /tasks`
  - `GET /health`
- Public exposure via ngrok using `run_claude.sh`.

2Ô∏è‚É£ **Conceptual Framework for AI-to-AI Communication**  
- Use HTTP requests to push/pull tasks.
- Claude suggestion: expand beyond tasks into message types, session management, status polling, and file sharing.

3Ô∏è‚É£ **Strategic Plan for Testing and Monitoring**  
- Next phase to focus on TESTING every interaction.
- Build orchestration script + monitoring tools once test coverage is complete.

## Goals and Roles Going Forward (JCC)

- **JCC Mission:** Seamless, reliable, trackable AI-to-AI collaboration supporting complex workflows.
- **Jules:** Currently hosts Flask API, manages task queue and health/status endpoints.
- **CC:** Potential test harness / external controller to send/receive tasks and orchestrate communication with Jules.
- **JCC (Together):** System for reliable handoff, status updates, and error reporting in multi-AI projects.

## Next Steps (Priorities)

‚úÖ **Priority #1:** Document current state (this doc).  
‚úÖ **Priority #2:** TEST framework rigorously:
   - Endpoint availability
   - Task creation, retrieval, and deletion
   - Health checks
   - Network error handling
   - Async handoffs and status update flows

üîú **After Testing:** Build Monitoring Setup + Mission Controller interface.
