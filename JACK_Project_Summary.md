# JACK Project Summary and Framework
**Date:** 2025-06-27  
**Updated:** 2025-06-29 ‚Äì project renamed from JCC to **JACK**

## Project Goals
- Establish a robust AI-to-AI framework between two agents: **Jules** (Flask API) and **Claude Code**‚Äîtogether called **JACK**.  
- Enable task hand-offs, shared context, and status reporting between JACK agents via HTTP.  
- Build a scalable foundation for orchestration, monitoring, and mission control.

## What We Have Done So Far
1Ô∏è‚É£ **Flask API (Jules)**  
   Endpoints: `POST /add_task`, `GET /tasks`, `GET /health` (public via ngrok).

2Ô∏è‚É£ **Conceptual framework** for AI-to-AI communication‚Äînext steps include richer message types and session management.

3Ô∏è‚É£ **Testing & monitoring plan** drafted; focus is to test every interaction before adding orchestration tools.

4Ô∏è‚É£ **Command-Line Interface added**  
   `jack_cli.py` lets us add tasks, list tasks, and check health (see `docs/jack_usage.md`).

## Roles Going Forward
- **Jules** ‚Äì hosts Flask API, manages task queue & health.  
- **Claude Code** ‚Äì external controller for tests and orchestration.  
- **JACK (together)** ‚Äì seamless, reliable, trackable AI collaboration.

## Next Steps (Priorities)
‚úÖ **Priority #1** Document current state (this doc)  
‚úÖ **Priority #2** Create rigorous test framework  
üîú **After testing** Add monitoring & mission-control interface

## CLI Utility
A new script `jack_cli.py` provides a lightweight command-line interface to
interact with Jules‚Äô API. See `docs/jack_usage.md` for usage details.
