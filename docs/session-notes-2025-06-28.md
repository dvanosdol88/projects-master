# Session Notes - 2025-06-28

## Summary of Today's Session

Today's session focused on establishing and testing the initial communication workflow between Jules and Claude Code (JACK), orchestrated by our human user and CGPT. Jules drafted a set of instructions for CC to create this notes file as a first test, and we iterated on the date to ensure accuracy.

## Key Decisions

*   We are performing an initial test of the Jules -> User -> Claude Code instruction pipeline.
*   Jules has provided a formatted message for the user to pass to Claude Code.
*   The session date for these notes is 2025-06-28.

## Next Steps

*   Claude Code to create this `session-notes-2025-06-28.md` file in the `docs/` directory.
*   Claude Code to stage, commit, and push the file with the commit message: "Add session notes for 2025-06-28"
