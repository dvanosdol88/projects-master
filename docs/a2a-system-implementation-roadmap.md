# a2a System Implementation Roadmap

This document outlines a phase-by-phase strategy for migrating the JACK system to a stable, message-driven architecture.

## Phase 0 – Discovery & Planning (1 week)

### Roles
- **Product Owner** – finalize scope: confirm HTTP API + broker and deprecate file-based mode.
- **ChatGPT** – generate design diagrams, sequence flows, and Terraform boilerplate for broker service provision.
- **All Devs** – review existing code; identify dependencies, shared libraries, and environment requirements.

### Tasks
1. Audit current Flask API and file-based messaging implementation.
2. Confirm choice of broker technology (Redis Streams or RabbitMQ).
3. Outline security, networking, and environment requirements.

### Deliverables
- Architecture diagram (HTTP API + broker).
- Updated requirements doc.
- Phase 1 sprint backlog.

### Checkpoints
- **Checkpoint 0.1** – design review call to align on architecture and confirm scope.

### Testing & Hardening
- Peer review of design artifacts.

## Phase 1 – Infrastructure Provisioning (1–2 weeks)

### Roles
- **DevOps Engineer** – provision broker service and configure networking, TLS, and firewall rules.
- **ChatGPT** – supply Terraform modules/snippets and Kubernetes/Compose templates for local development.
- **Backend Lead** – approve resource sizing, secrets management, and cost estimates.

### Tasks
1. Deploy Redis or RabbitMQ instance in the chosen environment.
2. Generate connection credentials and store them securely.
3. Verify broker connectivity from the Jules API and CLI tools.

### Deliverables
- Terraform/Compose scripts.
- Initial secrets and configuration files.

### Checkpoints
- Broker reachable from development environment.

### Testing & Hardening
- Unit test connection modules.
- Validate TLS setup and access controls.

## Phase 2 – Message API Integration (1–2 weeks)

### Roles
- **Backend Devs** – integrate broker client into Jules API.
- **ChatGPT** – provide publish/subscribe code samples and guidance.
- **QA** – expand tests for message flow.

### Tasks
1. Implement producer and consumer modules that interface with the broker.
2. Update `jack_cli.py` to publish tasks and read results through the broker.
3. Remove the file-based polling mechanism.

### Deliverables
- Updated API with broker support.
- Revised CLI with broker communication.
- Migration notes.

### Checkpoints
- End-to-end task submission works via the broker.

### Testing & Hardening
- Pytest coverage for publish and consume logic.
- Load testing with concurrent clients.

## Phase 3 – Stabilization & Monitoring (1 week)

### Roles
- **DevOps** – deploy monitoring for the broker and API.
- **Backend Devs** – fix bugs discovered during integration.

### Tasks
1. Instrument broker and API with health metrics and logging.
2. Create alerts for failed or stalled message delivery.
3. Document recovery procedures.

### Deliverables
- Monitoring dashboards.
- Incident response playbook.

### Checkpoints
- Successful run through a simulated outage.

### Testing & Hardening
- Chaos testing of broker restarts.
- Security review of message payloads.

## Phase 4 – Production Rollout (1 week)

### Roles
- **Product Owner** – sign off on readiness.
- **DevOps** – deploy to production infrastructure.
- **All Devs** – monitor and support rollout.

### Tasks
1. Tag release version and deploy the new architecture.
2. Decommission file-based messaging artifacts.
3. Review system performance after launch.

### Deliverables
- Final release notes.
- Updated documentation reflecting the message-driven architecture.

### Checkpoints
- Post-launch review meeting.

### Testing & Hardening
- Regression tests with real workloads.
- Ongoing monitoring and patching.
