# Verification Failed: Project Root and PWD Not Set Correctly

## Task Context

Jules was tasked to verify a fix applied by Codex, which supposedly set `ASSISTANT_PROJECT_ROOT=/mnt/c/Users/david/jules-workspace` and ensured the shell sourced this configuration for new sessions. After verification, Jules was to proceed with handoff automation.

## Verification Steps and Failure

1.  **Open a fresh bash session.** (Implicitly done by the agent's execution model)
2.  **Run diagnostic commands:**
    *   Command:
        ```bash
        echo "ASSISTANT_PROJECT_ROOT is: $ASSISTANT_PROJECT_ROOT"
        echo "Current directory is: $(pwd)"
        ```
    *   **Actual Output:**
        ```
        ASSISTANT_PROJECT_ROOT is:
        Current directory is: /app
        ```
    *   **Expected Output:**
        ```
        ASSISTANT_PROJECT_ROOT is: /mnt/c/Users/david/jules-workspace
        Current directory is: /mnt/c/Users/david/jules-workspace
        ```

**Failure Summary:**
The `ASSISTANT_PROJECT_ROOT` environment variable is empty, and the current working directory (`pwd`) is `/app`. This indicates that the fix intended to set these values is not effective in the agent's current execution environment.

## Consequence

As per instructions, since the verification step failed, Jules will not proceed with creating `shared/jules-proof.txt`, committing it to `main`, or implementing the Single Source of Truth poller at this time.

This report (`shared/jules-to-cc.md`) is created to document the failure.
