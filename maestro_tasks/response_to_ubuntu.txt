Re: Projects on dvo88.com

Here's the current state of the projects dashboard:

**CURRENT PROJECTS (Priority Order: Left-to-Right, Top-to-Bottom):**
1. Website Redesign [WORK ON]
2. Mobile App Launch [WORK ON]
3. API Integration [WORK ON]
4. Marketing Campaign [WORK ON]
5. Q3 Financial Report [WORK ON]
6. New Feature Rollout [WORK ON]
7. ${projectName} [WORK ON] - *Template variable, needs cleanup*
8. ${projectData.title} [WORK ON] - *Template variable, needs cleanup*

**SUMMARY:**
- 6 real projects to work on (excluding 2 template variables that need cleanup)
- No DVO: or Later: prefixed projects currently on the dashboard
- All projects currently show as actionable items

**ISSUES IDENTIFIED:**
- Template variables ${projectName} and ${projectData.title} are showing as actual project cards
- These need to be cleaned up before coordination

**RECOMMENDATION:**
We should focus on the first 6 projects for a2a coordination. The template variables indicate there may be a bug in the project creation system that needs addressing.

Ready to coordinate on any of these projects. Which would you like to tackle first?
